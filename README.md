# Environment-Data-Analysis
This project is an analysis of environmental data focusing on Air Quality Index (AQI) values across various cities. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model building for better insights into air quality trends.

# Installation
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/waleedmustafa971/environment-data-analysis.git
cd environment-data-analysis

2- Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

3- Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

- On macOS/Linux:
  source venv/bin/activate

4- Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

1- Data Preprocessing:

- The data_preprocessing.py script handles the loading and cleaning of the data.
- It drops rows with missing values and returns a cleaned DataFrame.

2- Data Visualization:

- The data_visualization.py script visualizes the cleaned data.
- The default visualization aggregates the PM2.5 AQI values by city and displays a bar plot of the top 20 cities with the highest average PM2.5 AQI values.

3- Running the Analysis:

- You can run the entire analysis by executing main.py:

python main.py


- This will load and preprocess the data, visualize it, and output the relevant plots.

# Example Output
Hereâ€™s an example of the output generated by the data visualization step:


# Data
- Source: The dataset used in this analysis is environment_data.csv, which contains AQI values for various pollutants across different cities.
- Columns:
= Country: The country of the recorded data.
= City: The city of the recorded data.
= AQI Value: The general AQI value.
= AQI Category: The category of air quality based on AQI.
= Specific pollutant-related columns such as CO AQI Value, Ozone AQI Value, etc.

# Future Work
- Enhance the data preprocessing to handle more complex missing data scenarios.
- Explore additional visualization techniques to uncover further insights.
- Implement machine learning models to predict AQI values based on historical data.
